# React Native App (Beta)

A React Native app built with the Whop SDK for creating mobile experiences.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+ 
- pnpm 9.15+
- A Whop app created in the [developer dashboard](https://whop.com/dashboard/developer)

### Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables:**
   Create a `.env.local` file with your Whop app credentials:
   ```env
   WHOP_APP_ID=your_app_id
   WHOP_APP_SECRET=your_app_secret
   WHOP_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret
   ```

3. **Build and ship your app:**
   ```bash
   pnpm ship
   ```

## üì± App Structure

- **Experience View** (`src/views/experience-view.tsx`): Main view shown when users access your app
- **Discover View** (`src/views/discover-view.tsx`): View shown when users discover your app

## üõ†Ô∏è Available Commands

- `pnpm build` - Build your app
- `pnpm upload` - Upload to Whop
- `pnpm clean` - Clean build files
- `pnpm ship` - Build and upload in one command

## üîß Development

### Testing on Device

1. Install your app into your Whop
2. Open the app from inside your Whop on your phone
3. **iOS**: Shake the device to enable dev mode
4. **Android**: Use the info button in the top right to toggle developer mode

### Testing Webhooks Without App Store

#### Method 1: Development Environment Testing
1. **Deploy to Development**: Use `pnpm ship` (already done)
2. **Configure Webhook URL**: In your Whop developer dashboard, set webhook URL to your local server
3. **Use ngrok for Public URL**: 
   ```bash
   # Install ngrok
   npm install -g ngrok
   
   # Create public tunnel to your local server
   ngrok http 3000
   ```
4. **Update Webhook URL**: Use the ngrok URL (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok.io/webhook/whop`)
5. **Test with Real Users**: Share your Whop link with specific people for testing

#### Method 2: Local Testing Interface
- Visit `http://localhost:3000/webhook-test`
- Simulate all webhook events
- Test greeting functionality with custom data

#### Method 3: Direct API Testing
```bash
# Test user join event
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/webhook/whop \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "user.joined_community",
    "data": {
      "user": {
        "id": "test_user_123",
        "username": "testuser",
        "name": "Test User"
      }
    }
